# Hand-written-Digits-Classification

### 1.Data:
MNIST dataset which contains 55,000 training data points and 10,000 test data points.   
Each data point consists of:  
-- an 28 * 28 image of a handwritten digit
-- a corresponding label of number 0-9

### 2. Neural Network Structure:
Input layer: flatten data of 28 * 28 = 784 units
Hidden layer: 2 hidden layers of 128 and 32 units
Output layer: 10 units with a softmax activation funciton
